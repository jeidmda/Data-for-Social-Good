# Unit 3 - Data for Social Good Project


## Introduction


Software engineers develop programs to work with data and provide information to a user. Each user has different needs based on the information they are looking for from data. Your goal is to create a data analysis program for your user that stores and analyzes data to provide the information they need.


## Requirements


Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, one-dimensional (1D) arrays, and algorithms to create your data analysis program:
- **Write a class** – Write a class to represent your user or business and store and analyze their data with no-argument and parameterized constructors.
- **Create at least two 1D arrays** – Create at least two 1D arrays to store the data that your user needs information about.
- **Write a method** – Write a method that finds or manipulates the elements in a 1D array to provide the information your user needs.
- **Implement a toString() method** – Write a toString() method that returns general information about the data (for example, number of values in the dataset).
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions.


## User Story


> As a Pokemon trainer, <br>
> I want to be the very best, like no one ever was, <br>
> so that I can benefit myself and other trainers who have the same goal.


## Dataset


Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abcsds/pokemon?resource=download
- **Name** (String) - name of the Pokemon
- **type1** (String) - the primary type of the Pokemon
- **type2** (String) - the secondary type of the Pokemon, if any
- **total** (int) - the base stat total of the Pokemon
- **legendary** (boolean) - whether or not the Pokemon is a Legendary Pokemon

## Description


Write a description of your project here. In your description, include as many vocab words from our class to explain your User Story, the chosen dataset and how your project addressed that users goals. If your project used the Scanner class for user input, explain how the user will interact with your project.


This project demonstrated my ability to create, access, and modify 1D arrays. I was able to use multiple arrays and traverse them all at the same time. Doing this allowed me to get information based on a certain requirement, using the index and accessing the information from each array. Our User Story was to become the best Pokemon Trainer, like no one ever was. To do this, we used a dataset that displays each Pokemon and its information.
